## A Framework to Estimate Cause-Specific Mortality Rates from Age-Specific Mortality Rates

Many countries lack any cause-of-death data. However, age- and cause- specific mortality are very correlated and information on age-specific mortality rates can be used to estimate the prevalence of certain causes of death. We want to develop a framework to perform this "conversion" and test it using data from a variety of countries around the world.
